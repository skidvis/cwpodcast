Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. I'm your host, Skid Vis, and we're here to break down the latest options trading trends. Before we dive in, remember, this is not to be considered financial advice.

Alright, wheel spinners, let's get into it. Despite SPY climbing an impressive 5.86% last week, we saw some interesting mixed signals from options traders. Our top five most active tickers were NVDA, TSLA, XOP, SOFI, and MSTR. Overall, there was a slight bearish tilt, with about 55% of trades being Puts.

NVDA took the spotlight this week, with traders primarily selling Puts. This suggests a bullish outlook on the chip giant. Moving to TSLA, we saw a pretty even split between Call and Put sales, indicating a neutral stance on everyone's favorite electric car maker.

XOP traders were busy selling Calls, which could be a move to hedge against upside risk in the oil and gas sector. Both SOFI and MSTR saw mostly Put sales, signaling bullish sentiment on these stocks.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Despite SPY's strong performance, this contrasting activity suggests traders might be playing it cautious with individual stocks. It could also mean they're looking to capitalize on high implied volatility.

Remember, folks, this is not to be considered financial advice. We're just here to spin the wheel and analyze the trends.

That's all for this week's CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. I'm Skid Vis, reminding you to keep those wheels covered and those options open. Until next time, happy trading!
