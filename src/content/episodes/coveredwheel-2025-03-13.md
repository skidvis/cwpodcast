Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up, I'm your host Kate. Before we dive in, remember, this is not to be considered financial advice. Let's get started with our market overview.

Despite the S&P 500, tracked by SPY, being down 2.42% last week, options traders showed a surprisingly bullish sentiment. Our data from CoveredWheel.com indicates that approximately 65% of trades were Puts versus 35% Calls. This could suggest that many traders are looking for potential entry points or are bullish on certain stocks despite the overall market decline.

Now, let's break down the top five tickers that caught our attention this week:

Starting with TSLA, we saw a predominantly bearish sentiment with 65% of trades being Puts. This could indicate that traders are anticipating a potential downside or are looking to capitalize on premium from out-of-the-money Puts.

NVDA showed a more balanced approach with an equal distribution of Puts and Calls. This might suggest that traders are uncertain about the stock's short-term direction and are playing both sides of the market.

Moving on to LUNR, we observed a strong preference for Puts. This bearish sentiment might be due to specific company news or broader sector trends affecting small-cap stocks.

Interestingly, both AI and SOFI saw exclusively Put activity. This could indicate that traders are either bearish on these stocks or are employing strategies like cash-secured Puts to potentially acquire shares at a lower price.

Other notable mentions this week include COIN, TEM, and HOOD, all of which saw some Put-selling activity. This could suggest that traders are bullish on these stocks at certain price levels and are willing to take on the obligation to buy shares if they fall to those prices.

Remember, the wheel strategy often involves selling Puts on stocks you wouldn't mind owning, and these patterns we're seeing could align with that approach.

That wraps up our analysis for this week. As always, please remember that this information is not financial advice, and it's crucial to do your own research before making any investment decisions.
