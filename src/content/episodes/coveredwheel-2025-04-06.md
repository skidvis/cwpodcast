Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up, I'm your host, Skid Vis. Before we dive in, remember, this is not to be considered financial advice. Let's get rolling with this week's options market rundown!

Alright, wheel enthusiasts, we've got some juicy data from CoveredWheel.com's usage last week, and boy, oh boy, it's a mixed bag of nuts out there.

Let's kick things off with our top 5 tickers. Coming in at number one, we've got NVDA, showing some serious indecision with 60% Calls and 40% Puts. Looks like traders can't make up their minds on this chip giant.

In the number two spot, we've got XOP riding high with 100% Calls. Seems like energy is the place to be, at least according to our wheel spinners.

Now, hold onto your hats, because the next three are all doom and gloom. HOOD, SMCI, and SOFI are all showing 100% Puts. That's right, not a single Call in sight for these tickers. Robinhood, Super Micro Computer, and SoFi Technologies are facing some serious bearish sentiment.

Overall, we're seeing a slight bearish tilt across all tickers, with about 55% Puts versus 45% Calls. It's like the market can't decide if it wants to be a bear or a bull, so it's settled on being a slightly grumpy cow.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Despite the S&P 500, tracked by SPY, taking a nosedive of 9.67%, NVDA and XOP are still seeing some bullish action. It's like they're swimming upstream while the rest of the market is going over the waterfall.

But don't get too excited. The majority of our top tickers are still bearish, which lines up with the broader market decline. We're also seeing bearish sentiment in other notable tickers like PLTR, TSLA, and LUNR. Looks like even Elon's Twitter antics couldn't save Tesla from the bear's claws this week.

Remember, folks, this is just what we're seeing from CoveredWheel.com's usage data. It's not a crystal ball, and it's certainly not financial advice. Always do your own research before making any trades.
