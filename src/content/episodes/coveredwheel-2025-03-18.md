# CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up: March 18, 2025

Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up! I'm your host, Kate, here to break down the most interesting trends we've seen on CoveredWheel.com over the past week.

## Top 5 Tickers of the Week

1. TSLA - Strong preference for Puts
2. LUNR - Mixed activity, leaning towards Puts
3. NVDA - Mixed activity, more Puts than Calls
4. SOFI - Dominated by Put options
5. HOOD - Dominated by Put options

## Overall Sentiment

- Put options made up about 70% of all contracts traded
- Bearish outlook despite SPY being up 0.66% for the week

## Notable Mentions

AI, AMD, and MARA also showed a preference for Put options, aligning with the overall bearish trend.

## Analysis

The abundance of Put options could suggest traders are hedging their bets or anticipating potential downturns in specific stocks. However, options activity doesn't always directly correlate with stock performance.

## Implications for Wheel Strategy

This data might influence how you approach your trades in the coming week. Consider opportunities to sell Puts at comfortable strikes or adjust your strategy based on this bearish sentiment.

Remember, the options market is complex and dynamic. Always do your own research before making any trading decisions.
