Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up! I'm your host, Kate, and we're diving into the most popular tickers from last week's activity on CoveredWheel.com. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that this is not to be considered financial advice. We're simply looking at the data and discussing trends.

Let's start with our top five tickers of the week. Coming in at number one, we have TSLA. Traders were leaning bearish on Tesla, with 65% of the activity focused on Puts. It seems like many were anticipating a potential downside or looking for protection.

In second place, we have NVDA. The split was a bit more even here, but still slightly bearish with 55% of the activity in Puts. Nvidia has been a hot stock lately, so it's interesting to see this slight bearish tilt.

The next three spots on our list – SOFI, LUNR, and TEM – all saw 100% Put activity. This is a pretty strong bearish signal for these stocks. It could indicate that traders are either very cautious about these companies or are seeing potential downside opportunities.

What's particularly interesting is that this overall bearish sentiment we're seeing in our top tickers contrasts with the broader market. The S&P 500, represented by SPY, was actually up 0.40% for the week. This divergence could suggest that our CoveredWheel users are either being cautious or seeing specific opportunities that differ from the broader market trend.

A couple of other noteworthy tickers outside our top five were MSTR and ACHR. MSTR saw an even split between Puts and Calls, suggesting a neutral outlook. ACHR, on the other hand, saw all Put activity, aligning with the bearish trend we're seeing in most of our top tickers.

Remember, the wheel strategy involves selling Puts and potentially getting assigned shares, then selling Calls against those shares. So, this high Put activity could indicate that many traders are in the first phase of the wheel, looking to potentially enter positions at lower prices.

That wraps up our look at last week's CoveredWheel activity. As always, remember that this is not financial advice, and it's crucial to do your own research and understand the risks involved in options trading. Thanks for tuning in to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. I'm Kate, and I'll catch you next week!
