Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up! I'm your host, Kate, and I'm excited to dive into this week's options trading activity. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that this is not to be considered financial advice. Always do your own research and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions.

Let's start with our top five tickers from last week's CoveredWheel.com usage. Coming in at number one, we have TSLA. Tesla saw a significant lean towards Puts, with 64% of the activity on the Put side and 36% on the Call side. This suggests a somewhat bearish sentiment among our users for the electric vehicle giant.

In second place, we have NVDA. Nvidia showed a slightly more bullish trend, with 55% of the activity in Calls and 45% in Puts. It's interesting to see this tech behemoth bucking the overall bearish trend we're observing in the market.

The third, fourth, and fifth spots are occupied by SOFI, LUNR, and TEM, respectively. All three of these tickers saw predominantly Put activity, indicating a bearish outlook from our users.

Now, let's talk about the broader market sentiment. Despite the S&P 500, tracked by SPY, being down 4.15% last week, we're seeing mixed sentiment on tech giants. As mentioned earlier, TSLA is leaning bearish, while NVDA is showing a slightly bullish trend. The smaller cap stocks in our top five – SOFI, LUNR, and TEM – are seeing more bearish positioning with their predominantly Put activity.

It's worth noting that a few other tickers caught our users' attention last week. These include MSTR, ACHR, and GOOG. While they didn't make it into our top five, they're definitely worth keeping an eye on.

Remember, folks, the wheel strategy is all about managing risk and generating income, regardless of market conditions. Whether you're selling Puts on stocks you wouldn't mind owning or Calls on stocks you already hold, always consider your risk tolerance and overall portfolio strategy.

That's all for this week's CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. I'm Kate, reminding you once again that this is not to be considered financial advice. Happy trading, and we'll see you next week!
