Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up! I'm your host, Kate, and we're diving into the most popular tickers from last week's activity on CoveredWheel.com. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that this is not to be considered financial advice. We're simply discussing trends and data.

Let's kick things off with our top 5 tickers of the week. Coming in at number one, we have Tesla, or TSLA. Interestingly, despite the overall market downturn, TSLA saw a mix of options activity with a slight lean towards Puts at 62%. This could suggest that while some traders are cautious, others see potential upside.

In second place, we have NVDA, showing a balanced approach with a small preference for Calls at 55%. This might indicate a cautiously optimistic outlook among traders for the chip giant.

The next three spots on our list all show a decidedly bearish sentiment. SOFI, MSTR, and TEM all saw exclusively Put activity. This aligns with the broader market decline, as represented by SPY being down 4.59% for the week.

It's worth noting that despite the overall bearish tilt in the options market, we're seeing some nuanced approaches to TSLA and NVDA. Traders seem to be taking a more measured stance on these tech heavyweights, possibly looking for opportunities amidst the market volatility.

Remember, the wheel strategy involves selling cash-secured Puts and covered Calls, so this mix of bullish and bearish sentiment can present interesting opportunities for those running the wheel.

As always, it's crucial to do your own research and consider your personal risk tolerance before making any trading decisions. The market can be unpredictable, and what works for one trader may not work for another.

That wraps up our CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. I'm Kate, reminding you once again that this is not to be considered financial advice. Happy trading, and we'll see you next week!
