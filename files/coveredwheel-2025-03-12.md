Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up! I'm your host, Kate, and we're diving into the most active tickers on CoveredWheel.com from last week. Remember, this is not to be considered financial advice.

Let's kick things off with our top 5 tickers. Coming in at number one, we have Tesla, ticker TSLA. Traders were leaning bearish on this electric vehicle giant, with 64% of the activity in Puts and 36% in Calls. It seems like many were betting on a potential downside for Tesla.

In the number two spot, we have Nvidia, ticker NVDA. Interestingly, despite the overall market being down, NVDA saw slightly more bullish sentiment with 55% of the activity in Calls and 45% in Puts. Looks like some traders are still optimistic about the chip maker's prospects.

Moving on to our third most active ticker, we have Intuitive Machines, ticker LUNR. This one saw mostly Put activity, indicating a bearish outlook from our traders.

SoFi Technologies, ticker SOFI, takes the fourth spot. Again, we're seeing a trend here with mostly Put activity, suggesting a cautious or bearish stance on this fintech company.

Rounding out our top 5 is Tempest Therapeutics, ticker TEM. Following the trend of our smaller cap stocks this week, TEM also saw predominantly Put activity.

Now, let's talk about the broader market sentiment. Despite the S&P 500, tracked by SPY, being down 4.15% last week, we're seeing mixed sentiment on tech giants. As mentioned earlier, Tesla is leaning bearish while Nvidia is slightly bullish. The smaller cap stocks in our top 5 - LUNR, SOFI, and TEM - are all seeing more bearish positioning with predominantly Put activity.

A few other tickers worth mentioning that saw notable activity include AI, MSTR, and ACHR. These didn't make our top 5 but were still on traders' radars.

That wraps up our CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. Remember, this information is based on options activity and should not be considered financial advice. Always do your own research before making any investment decisions. I'm Kate, and I'll catch you next week for another round-up of options action!
