Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up! I'm your host, Kate, and we're diving into the most interesting options trends from the past week. Remember, this is not to be considered financial advice.

Alright, let's jump right in with our top 5 tickers based on CoveredWheel.com usage. Coming in at number one, we have Tesla, ticker TSLA. Traders were leaning bearish on this electric vehicle giant, with 62% of activity in Puts versus 38% in Calls. It seems like there's some caution in the air for Tesla.

In second place, we have NVIDIA, ticker NVDA. This one's interesting because we're seeing a pretty balanced approach. 55% of the action was in Calls, while 45% was in Puts. Looks like traders are a bit split on NVIDIA's short-term prospects.

Now, for our third, fourth, and fifth place tickers, we're seeing a clear trend. SOFI, MSTR, and TEM all had activity entirely in Puts. That's right, 100% Puts for these tickers. It seems like traders using CoveredWheel.com are taking a decidedly bearish stance on these smaller cap stocks.

Let's talk about the broader market sentiment. Despite the S&P 500, tracked by SPY, being down a significant 4.89% last week, we're seeing some interesting divergences. Traders seem to be cautiously optimistic about certain tech stocks, particularly NVIDIA with its balanced options activity.

However, the overall tilt is slightly bearish. Across our top tickers, approximately 60% of trades were Puts. This suggests that while there's some optimism in pockets of the market, traders are generally playing it safe and potentially hedging against downside risks.

It's crucial to remember that options trading, especially strategies like the wheel, require careful consideration and risk management. Always do your own research and consider your personal financial situation before making any trading decisions.

That wraps up our CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. I'm Kate, reminding you once again that this is not to be considered financial advice. Happy trading, and we'll see you next week!
