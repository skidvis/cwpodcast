Welcome to The CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up! I'm your host, Kate, and we're diving into the most popular tickers and market sentiment from last week's activity on CoveredWheel.com. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that this is not to be considered financial advice. Always do your own research and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions.

Let's kick things off with our top five tickers from last week. Coming in at number one, we have TSLA. Tesla traders were leaning bearish, with 62% of the activity in Puts and 38% in Calls. It seems like many wheel strategy enthusiasts were positioning themselves for potential downside or looking to get assigned at lower prices.

In the number two spot, we have NVDA. Nvidia saw a more balanced mix, with a slight bullish tilt. 45% of the activity was in Puts, while 55% was in Calls. This suggests that traders might be seeing some upside potential in the chip giant.

The remaining top tickers were dominated by Put activity. SOFI, MSTR, and TEM all saw mostly Put trades, indicating a cautious or bearish outlook among wheel strategy users for these stocks.

Now, let's talk about the broader market sentiment. Despite the S&P 500, tracked by SPY, being down 3.99% last week, we saw mixed sentiment across different stocks. This divergence is interesting and could suggest that traders are becoming more selective in their outlook rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach to the market.

Some other notable tickers that caught our attention this week were AMD, LUNR, and COIN. While they didn't make the top five, they still saw significant activity on the platform.

Remember, the wheel strategy involves selling cash-secured Puts and covered Calls, so this Put-heavy activity doesn't necessarily mean everyone's betting on a market crash. Many traders could be looking to get assigned shares at lower prices or collect premium while waiting for better entry points.

As always, it's crucial to consider your own risk tolerance and investment goals when implementing any options strategy. The market can be unpredictable, and what works for one trader might not be suitable for another.

That wraps up our CoveredWheel Weekly Wrap-up. I'm Kate, reminding you once again that this is not to be considered financial advice. Happy trading, and we'll see you next week!
